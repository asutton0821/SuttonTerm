# SuttonTerm
A small terminal based on the Operating Systems lab by Gary Nutt. 


This terminal will import your basic paths and then accept commands based on the executables in that path. This program accepts as many whitespace characters as a normal terminal, and splits the strings accordingly. 

Please note, "cd" will not work in this version of minishell as it is a built-in function and not contained in a path variable.
